    <p class="description">It was a dramatic weekend at Zandvoort, with Oscar Piastri winning, team mate Lando Norris retiring, Isack Hadjar scoring a maiden podium finish and Ferrari suffering a double DNF. So, who impressed our judges through it all? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...</p>

    <h2 class="title">HOW IT WORKS</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Our five-judge panel assess each driver after every Grand Prix and score them out of 10 according to their performance across the weekend – taking machinery out of the equation</li>
      <li class="ruang">Our experts’ scores are then averaged out to produce a race score – with those scores then tallied up across the season on our overall Power Rankings Leaderboard (at the bottom of the page)</li>
    </ul>
